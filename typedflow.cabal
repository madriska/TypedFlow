version:        0.9
synopsis:       Typed frontend to TensorFlow and higher-order deep learning
description:    TypedFlow is a typed, higher-order frontend to TensorFlow and a high-level library for deep-learning.
                .
                The main design principles are:
                .
                - To make the parameters of layers explicit. This choice makes sharing of parameters explicit and allows to implement "layers" as pure functions.
                .
                - To provide as precise as possible types. Functions are explicit about the shapes and elements of the tensors that they manipulate (they are often polymorphic in shapes and elements though.)
                .
                - To let combinators be as transparent as possible. If a NN layers is a simple tensor transformation it will be exposed as such.
